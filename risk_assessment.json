    "question_text": "What compelling evidence suggests industrial customers, data centers, and other target segments will adopt Generation IV nuclear technology despite historically slow nuclear adoption rates, the availability of faster-to-deploy renewable alternatives, and lingering public safety concerns?",
    "risk_category": "Technology Adoption Risk",
    "probability": 4,
    "impact": 5,
    "risk_score": 20,
    "risk_tier": "High",
    "justification": "Industrial customers and data centers typically prioritize speed to deployment, cost certainty, and public perception in energy decisions. Historical adoption rates for nuclear technology have been extremely slow, and without compelling evidence of market pull rather than technological push, this pre-revenue startup faces significant adoption barriers that could undermine its entire business model."

    "question_text": "Given that only two new nuclear plants have been constructed in the US over the past 20 years despite numerous applications, how will the venture navigate the complex regulatory landscape and lengthy NRC approval process to achieve timely market entry and scale?",
    "risk_category": "Regulatory & Policy Risk",
    "probability": 5,
    "impact": 4,
    "risk_score": 20,
    "risk_tier": "High",
    "justification": "The Nuclear Regulatory Commission's approval process represents an extreme barrier to market entry that has prevented numerous nuclear projects from reaching completion. For a pre-revenue Series C startup, regulatory delays will directly impact capital requirements and extend the timeline to commercialization, putting significant pressure on investor returns and potentially requiring additional funding rounds."

    "question_number": 1,
    "question_text": "How will the venture establish meaningful market differentiation and overcome competitive barriers in an industry where three established players control 58% of the market, while simultaneously competing with increasingly cost-effective renewable energy solutions and low-cost natural gas alternatives?",
    "risk_category": "Competitive Landscape Risk",
    "probability": 4,
    "impact": 4,
    "risk_score": 16,
    "risk_tier": "High",
    "justification": "The nuclear market is highly concentrated with entrenched competitors, while simultaneously facing competition from increasingly affordable renewables and natural gas. As a pre-revenue Series C startup, establishing sufficient differentiation to capture meaningful market share will be exceptionally challenging without revolutionary cost or performance advantages."

    "question_number": 3,
    "question_text": "Given the historical decline in nuclear power's market share (from 19.1% to 17.6% between 2019-2023) and modest industry growth projections (1.4% CAGR through 2029), what specific evidence supports the venture's TAM projections and growth assumptions for Generation IV nuclear technology?",
    "risk_category": "Market Size & Growth Risk",
    "probability": 3,
    "impact": 5,
    "risk_score": 15,
    "risk_tier": "High",
    "justification": "The venture's growth projections must be viewed against the backdrop of nuclear power's declining market share and modest industry growth. For a Series C startup with significant capital requirements, overestimating the addressable market for Generation IV technology would critically impact valuation and return potential, especially as competing energy sources continue to gain market share."

    "question_number": 5,
    "question_text": "How vulnerable is the venture's market potential to external factors such as fluctuating uranium prices (which surged 98% in 2024), potential reductions in government incentives, and policy shifts favoring renewable energy sources?",
    "risk_category": "Strategic Positioning Risk",
    "probability": 4,
    "impact": 3,
    "risk_score": 12,
    "risk_tier": "Medium",
    "justification": "Nuclear ventures are particularly vulnerable to external factors including fuel prices, shifting government incentives, and changing energy policies. The recent 98% surge in uranium prices demonstrates the volatility in input costs, while political uncertainty creates regulatory risk. These factors could significantly alter the cost-competitiveness of the startup's technology relative to increasingly affordable renewable alternatives."
