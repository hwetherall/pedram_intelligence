    "justification": "** Policy and regulatory shifts affecting nuclear power are likely given historical volatility in energy policy and the politically contentious nature of nuclear energy. The impact could be catastrophic as unfavorable regulatory decisions or policy changes could completely halt deployment, regardless of technological readiness or market demand.\n\n##",
    "question": "How might changes in government policies and incentives, such as the Inflation Reduction Act, affect the market demand for nuclear power, and what regulatory risks could impede X-Energy's time-to-market compared to competitors?"

    "justification": "** The contradiction between X-Energy's growth projections and industry decline creates a high probability of market overestimation. If actual addressable market proves substantially smaller, this would significantly threaten business viability by undermining the entire investment thesis and revenue model.\n\n##",
    "question": "How does X-Energy reconcile its projected $7.0 billion Worldwide TAM by 2024 with the broader nuclear power industry's declining revenue (-0.9% CAGR 2019-2024) and decreasing grid share (from 19.1% to 17.6% 2019-2023)?"

    "justification": "** Market barriers to nuclear adoption are virtually certain to persist based on historical patterns and current market conditions. The impact is moderated by X-Energy's potential technological advantages and policy support, but will still require significant resources and strategy adjustments to overcome.\n\n##",
    "question": "What are the primary market barriers to the adoption of Generation IV nuclear technology, and how does X-Energy plan to overcome these challenges compared to competing clean energy alternatives?"

    "justification": "** While there's theoretical demand for clean industrial heat and hydrogen production, the commercial viability remains uncertain, making insufficient market demand possible. If these specialized markets fail to materialize at projected scale, X-Energy would face major impacts requiring substantial business model revision.\n\n##",
    "question": "How does X-Energy's focus on industrial heat applications and hydrogen production differentiate it from competitors, and what market research validates sufficient demand in these sectors to justify the pivot away from traditional electricity generation?"
