    "Given the strategic partnership with Dow as a first customer, how might we leverage this relationship to create a repeatable customer acquisition model for other industrial players facing similar decarbonization challenges?",
    "How can we better articulate the unique value proposition of Generation IV nuclear for industrial heat applications, where our competitive advantage appears strongest compared to renewable alternatives?",
    "Given the substantial government support already secured ($1.2B in federal grants), what systematic approach could we develop to maintain policy momentum through administration changes and budget cycles?"

    "What would a more conservative, staged market entry strategy look like if we acknowledge that regulatory timelines will likely be 2-3x longer than our current projections?",
    "How might we reframe our market sizing methodology to address the significant discrepancy between our projected TAM growth and historical nuclear adoption rates shown in third-party market reports?",
    "What if we developed a hybrid offering that pairs our nuclear solution with complementary renewable technologies, creating a transitional pathway that reduces customer adoption risk while regulatory approvals progress?"

  "i_wonder_reflection": [
    "If small modular renewable + storage solutions achieve price parity with our technology before our regulatory approval process completes, how fundamentally does that alter our value proposition for data centers and other key customers?",
    "To what extent could shifting geopolitical tensions around energy security create unexpected tailwinds (or headwinds) for domestic nuclear technology adoption in our key markets?",
    "What if we reframed our market entry strategy around 'critical infrastructure resilience' rather than just 'decarbonization' - how might this open different customer segments or funding mechanisms less vulnerable to policy shifts?"
