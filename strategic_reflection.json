    "With blue-chip investors like Dow, OPG, and Ares already on board, how might we strategically showcase their continued commitment to accelerate adoption among risk-averse industrial customers?"

    "Considering the stark contrast between our projected growth and the historical decline in nuclear power's market share, what fundamental market assumptions need re-validation through direct customer discovery?",
    "What would a truly resilient go-to-market strategy look like if we assume a 3-5 year delay in regulatory approval, rather than planning around optimistic timelines?",
    "Given the intensifying competition from increasingly cost-effective renewables, how might we reframe our value proposition to emphasize unique benefits beyond just clean baseload power (such as industrial heat applications where renewables cannot compete)?"

    "What if we segmented our market entry strategy to focus exclusively on industrial heat applications for the first five years, postponing power generation and hydrogen production until after establishing a proven track record?",
    "To what extent could unexpected fluctuations in uranium prices (which surged 98% in 2024) fundamentally alter our cost competitiveness against alternative energy sources?",
    "If another nuclear incident occurred globally, how prepared is our market positioning to withstand the inevitable public perception backlash and potential regulatory freezes?",
    "How would our market opportunity transform if carbon pricing mechanisms became widespread across the US industrial sector within the next 3-5 years?"
